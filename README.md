## App Analysis Using Python 
This project is for finding app profiles based on data, that will attract more users. Considering that we want to build apps that are free to download and install, the main revenue source consists of in-app ads. Hence, the amount of users downloading the app and using it, is what matters in terms of profit. Hence, for making profitable apps, we need to analyse data that shows the category of apps in which most users are interested in.
